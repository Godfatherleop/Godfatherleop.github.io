                    <p>Hi! I am an Engineering graduate from Thapathali Engineering Campus, passionate about technology and innovation. I am particularly focused on building a career in DevOps and Security, with a strong interest in understanding how deployment, operation and management is done in real-world scenarios.</p>
                    <p>Alongside my academic journey, I have been exploring concepts such as system infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud platforms. My goal is to become a skilled DevOps Engineer, contributing to the automation, scalability, and reliability of software delivery and infrastructure systems.</p>
                    <p>Apart from my technical interests, I enjoy learning about emerging technologies and working on projects that integrate both hardware and software solutions. I am also actively involved in voluntary organizations like Leo Clubs, where I engage in social service and leadership activities. These experiences have helped me develop strong teamwork, communication, and leadership skills. I am always eager to take on new challenges, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and grow professionally in the field of Networking</p>
